# Animal-Species-Prediction

Using the Animals-10 dataset, which was collected from the Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10 . 

The data contains about 28K medium quality animal image belonging to 10 different categories including dog, cat, horse, spider, butterfly, chicken, sheep, cow, squirrel, and elephant. The data was selected to create the animal specifies prediction model for animal image classifiers based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with accurate results.
